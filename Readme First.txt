Instructions

For Changing Textures you have to move mouse while Glut Down and 
with that press the desired number key to change the texture. Keys are:
'1' is for Marble Texture
'2' is for Chess Board Texture
'3' is for Chrome Texture
'4' is for Multiple Texture

Rotation can be done by left click and translation can be done by right 
click of mouse.

Another object added is the Cone with different texture than the teapot.

I have added the jpeg library but still if you get error because of jpeglib.h, 
then you can manually install it by this command: 
"sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev".

Thank You
